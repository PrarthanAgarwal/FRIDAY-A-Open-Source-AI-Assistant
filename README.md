# F.R.I.D.A.Y MARK II

## Performance Upgrade Goals
- Reduce response time from 15-20s to 2.5-5s
- Implement parallel processing
- Enhance voice interaction quality

## Technical Improvements
- Replace OpenVoice with Coqui TTS
- Switch to Whisper.cpp for transcription
- Implement llama.cpp for faster inference
- Add parallel processing capabilities

## Migration Schedule
- Week 1: Voice processing optimization
- Week 2: FastAPI & Redis implementation
- Week 3: LLM optimization
- Week 4: System integration & testing

## Performance Metrics
### Before (Original)
- Total Response Time: 15-20 seconds
- Sequential Processing
- Limited to single operations

### Target (MARK II)
- Total Response Time: 2.5-5 seconds
- Parallel Processing
- Multiple simultaneous operations
